# About Me

I am a HPC and Quantum Software Engineer at Microsoft Quantum

## Personal Philosophy

* My three beliefs:
  * "The highest achievement is to be of service to others"
  * "Success is found in a relentless pursuit of continuous improvement"
  * "A team ultimately only reaches its highest potential through personal sacrifice for the good of the whole"

* I strive to live life in accordance with Stoic principles, though I fall short often
* I have a natural inclination to surround myself with people who challenge me, whether actively or passively - I want to be around those who I can grow and learn from.
